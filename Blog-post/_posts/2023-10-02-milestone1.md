## 1. Data Acquisition
<b> NHL Stats API </b><br>

The NHL offers an API that provides access to extensive play by play information for all NHL games, including both regular season and playoff matches. This data is highly detailed. We can utilise this data for analysis of aspects such as individual player performance and team patterns.

To obtain the play by play data, for a game we send a GET request to the following API endpoint;
{% highlight python %}
https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ <game_id> /feed/live/
{% endhighlight %}

with game_id representing the ID of the game you want to retrieve data for. All other useful REST endpoints can be found at the unofficial API found here: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md


<b> Extracting Data for a single Game </b><br>

Since we've identified the correct endpoint of interest using the game_id, we now want a means to extract the data. We can utilise the Python requests API (https://pypi.org/project/requests/) using the follwing code snippit:

{% highlight python %}
requests.get('https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/'+str(game_id)+'/feed/live/')
{% endhighlight %}

This will give us a JSON extract of the play-by-play data for that one game.

<b> Extracting Data for Seasons</b><br>

To get all data for specified seasons we need a way of getting all game_ids for a specific season first. To get that we can utilise the NHL API schedule endpoint (https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/schedule) to get all game_ids for a specified season. The function we have that does just that that is:

{% highlight python %}
_get_associated_game_ids(self, game_type: str, season: str)
{% endhighlight %}

where game_type can be either 'R' for Regular or 'P' for Playoffs and season is a string of the speicfied season, Ex. "20162017". 

_get_associated_game_ids() is a private method as it is an internal helper function to get all data for one season. That function is the following:

{% highlight python %}
download_play_by_play_data_for_season(self, season: str, game_type:str)
{% endhighlight %}

Using this method we can retrieve all data for a single season/game-type specified. We can then effeciently loop through all combinations of seasons and playoffs needed and retrieve all their data. We achieve this in the following accessbile function:

{% highlight python %}
download_all_play_by_play_data(self, seasons:list, game_types:list)
{% endhighlight %}

where seasons is a list of seasons and game_types list of all data needed. Example usage:

{% highlight python %}
from dataAcquisition import DataAcquisition

data_aquirer = DataAcquisition()
seasons = ['20162017', '20172018', '20182019', '20192020', '20202021']
game_types = ['R', 'P']

data_aquirer.download_all_play_by_play_data(seasons, game_types)
{% endhighlight %}

All JSONs will be downloaded under a "data/" directory under your current directory.

    The tool in this part is an interactive tool to see the game information.
    
     It contains the type of the game that we can choose the type base on play off and regular.
     
    Year of the game that contains years of 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020. The index bar is indentifier of the game. The index bar on the right is counter of the events in a game.


    After choosing the game based on the specifications, we get the information related to the game and the map of the event where and when it happened.
    
     Also we can see who made the event and what is the result.

    here we have the game mode "Play off", in 2019, game number 174, event 54.

## 3. Tidy Data

### Data Snippet

![Insert screenshot of final dataframe here using head(10)](/assets/images/dataframe.png)

### Determining On-Ice Strength for Shots and Goals

A team's strength can fluctuate due to penalties, leading to power play opportunities or being short-handed. Here's an approach to determine the on-ice strength for each shot or goal:

1. **Initialize Counters**: 
   For each shot or goal event, start by initializing two counters, both set to 5. This represents even strength (5 on 5, excluding goalies).

2. **Assess Recent History**:
   Read the `dateTime` attribute of the shot or goal and look backward in the `liveData` dictionary until you find an event that occurred more than 5 minutes prior. This 5-minute window captures any penalties that could affect the on-ice strength.

3. **Handle Penalties**:
   - For events of type `PENALTY` that are labeled as major penalties, identify the penalized team.
   - Decrease the counter for that team by 1, irrespective of any goals scored during the penalty. 
   **Handle Minor Penalties**:
   - If there's an event of type `PENALTY` that's labeled as a minor penalty, check if its `dateTime` is within 2 minutes of the current shot or goal event.
   - If it's within this 2-minute window, determine the penalized team. Decrease the counter for that team by 1. If it's outside this window, the penalty has expired, and you can ignore it.

4. **Assign Strength**:
   Create the `strength` attribute for each shot or goal by displaying the counters of both teams. For instance, if Team A is shooting on Team B, and the counters are 4 and 5 respectively, the strength would be represented as "4 on 5".

### Additional Features from the Dataset

From the available dataset:

1. **Rebound Shots**: Identify a rebound shot by observing two consecutive shots from the same team that happen quickly and are close in location. The subsequent shot can be labeled as a rebound.
2. **Rush Shots**: Classify a shot as a "rush shot" if it occurs shortly after a defensive event for the same team, indicating rapid puck movement from the defensive to offensive zone.
3. **Zone Time Before Shot**: Measure the duration a team spends in the offensive zone before taking a shot. It can highlight a team's possession and pressure abilities. Track events like offensive zone "FACEOFF" wins or "TAKEAWAY" to start the timer, and stop it at the next shot event.


## 4. Simple Visualizations 

### Question 1: Comparing The Shot Types Over All Teams
![comparing the shot types over all teams](/assets/images/shotTypes.png)
#### Description:
From the provided chart, the shot types are categorized by their frequency (count) and the associated goal rate (percentage of shots that result in a goal).

**Most Common Shot Type:** The 'Wrist Shot' is the most common shot type as its count surpasses all other shot types by a significant margin.

**Most Dangerous Shot Type:** Based on goal rate, the 'Tip in' shot type appears to be the most dangerous in season 2020-2021, with a goal rate of 21.98%. 

#### Discussion:

Wrist shots are the most frequently used shot type, which might be due to the fact that they can be executed quickly and require less space compared to other shots. They are versatile and can be taken from various angles and positions on the ice.

However, The 'Tip in' shots have the highest goal rate. This makes sense as tip-ins involve players redirecting a shot.

### Question 2: Analysis of Conversion Rate and Total Shots by Shot Distance

---

**Note on Shot Distance Calculation**:

When calculating the distance of shots, we've based our methodology on a typical result observed in NHL matches. Specifically, the coordinates of goals scored right at the goal line appear to be more like `(84,0)` for North American matches. For a detailed reference, you can review this [discussion on RapidMiner Community](https://community.rapidminer.com/discussion/44904/using-the-nhl-api-to-analyze-pro-ice-hockey-data-part-1).

Furthermore, based on NHL statistics, it's assumed that all shots are aimed at the nearest goal. This assumption aligns with observations and data from the NHL, as detailed in this [OMHA article on the science of scoring](https://www.omha.net/news_article/show/667329-the-science-of-scoring).

![Season 2019-2020](/assets/images/20192020.png)
![Season 2020-2021](/assets/images/20202021.png)
#### Conversion Rate vs Shot Distance:

**Close to Goal**:
- Shots taken between 0-10 feet from the goal have a high conversion rate of around 20%.
  
**Mid-Range Shots**:
- As players shoot from further out, the conversion rate drops significantly. 
  
**Long Shots**:
- Beyond 35 feet, the conversion rate is relatively stable. At distances of 80 meters and beyond, the rate is nearly zero, but there's a noticeable spike between 85-95 meters.

#### Total Shots vs Shot Distance:

**Most Popular Distance**:
- The majority of shots are taken from 5-10 feet.
  
**Steady Range**:
- Between 15-55 feet, the number of shots remains fairly consistent.
  
**Rare Long Shots**:
- Shots from distances greater than 80 meters are uncommon, which aligns with the low conversion rates observed from those distances.

#### Summary:

The shot patterns and conversion rates have been consistent over the past three seasons. The reason we chose this graph is that the graph effectively displays these trends and by juxtaposing the shot count with the conversion rate, the visualization effectively dispels potential misconceptions — like a low shot count yielding an anomalously high conversion rate.


### Question 3: Analysis of Goal Rate and Shots Types by Shot Distance

---

**Note on Data Representation and Filtering**:

In creating this plot, we have employed simple descriptive statistics (e.g., the median or the 25th percentile of shot counts) to represent the goal percentages for each shot type across various distances. Importantly, to ensure the accuracy and prevent potential misinterpretations of the results, we have set a fixed threshold for the number of shots taken at a specific distance.

Specifically, only shot types with a count greater than 20 at a particular distance have been included in the graph. This threshold was set to avoid visualizing shot types with low sample sizes, which could produce misleading insights or overemphasize rare occurrences.

```python
threshold = 20
grouped_type = grouped_type[grouped_type['total_shots'] > threshold]
```

---

![comparing the shot types and distance](/assets/images/function_shot_distance.png)
#### Finding:

**High Goal Percentage**: 
- The "Slap Shot" is the most effective when taken from both close and medium distance range (0-35). Its goal rate is the highest among that range.  So that it appears to be the most dangerous shot type.

**Medium To Long Distance Shots**: 
- The "Tip in" shots shows effectiveness at the range of 40-60 feet , with a higher goal percentage than others. 
- The "Wrist Shot" has a higher likelihood of resulting in goals

**Consistency Across Distances**: 
- "Slap Shot" and "Snap Shot" have relatively consistent goal rates across various distances, especially from 10-55. Their consistency might make them reliable shot choices in many game situations

<b>Interpretting the Shot Maps</b><br>

* The season shotmaps above show us the rate of team shots and heatmap of their shots. What we can clearly see from these interactive figures is that most of the teams shoot when they are near the net. Another observation is that the some of the teams shoot from the sides while some teams such as Vancuver canucks shoot when they are at the middle. Feel free to interact with the above figures, pick your favourite team and track their shot patterns accross the 5 seasons!

<b>Discussion on Colorado Avalanche</b><br>

* During the 2016-2017 season, the Colorado Avalanche displayed a notably reduced shot frequency in the near area of the net, approximately 15-25 feet away from it, in contrast to the league's standard shot frequency from the same spot.

    In the 2020-2021 season, the Colorado Avalanche had a different way of play-style, as they showed a higher-than-average shot frequency near the net, indicating a significant difference in their approach to the game.

<b>Buffalo Sabres VS Tampa Bay Lightning</b><br>

* Shot Range:

    Both teams tend to take shots in the near-to-mid-range area, which is 10 to 50 feet away from the net. This suggests that they prefer quality scoring opportunities rather than long-range attempts.
    Buffalo Sabres:

    The Sabres show a relatively balanced approach in terms of shot distribution on the left and right sides of the net.
    They tend to have fewer shots in the middle position, which could indicate a preference for shooting from the sides.
    This pattern may suggest that the Sabres are trying to create scoring chances from various angles.
    Tampa Bay Lightning:

    The Tampa Bay Lightning's shot map reveals a concentration of shots in the middle position.
    They appear to have a strategic focus on the high-scoring central area in front of the net.
    The Lightning takes fewer shots from the sides, indicating that they rely more on plays through the center, possibly exploiting opportunities in front of the net.

    Buffalo's approach of distributing shots across the left and right sides might be an attempt to make their attack more diverse, taking advantage of opportunities that arise on both sides.
    Tampa Bay's emphasis on the middle position may reflect a strategy to capitalize on high-percentage scoring chances in the most critical area in front of the net.

    Overall, The Lightning's success could be attributed to their strategy of capitalizing on high-percentage scoring opportunities in front of the net. Their focus on the middle position indicates a strong commitment to effective offensive plays and converting these chances into goals.


    The shot distribution observations provide valuable insights, but they do not offer a comprehensive explanation for a team's performance. For instance we do not have any information about team chemistry, coaching, and leadership.
